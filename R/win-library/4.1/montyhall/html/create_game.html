<h2>Create a new Monty Hall Problem game.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>create_game()</code> generates a new game that consists of two doors
with goats behind them, and one with a car.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
create_game()
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>no arguments are used by the function.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The game setup replicates the game on the TV show &quot;Let's
Make a Deal&quot; where there are three doors for a contestant
to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two
have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host
opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is
given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous
debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when
given the option to switch, so this simulation was created
to test both strategies.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a length 3 character vector
indicating the positions of goats and the car.
</p>
